=head1 DESCRIPTION

Acme::Inkling is a Perl 6 module that allows Inkling to eat away source code.

'<=:=' (squid ascii art) is assignment operator.
But assigned value is inked.
'くコ:彡' and '🦑' have same meaning.

When you load this modules, This project is eaten away by Inkling.
So you can 'say' only Inkling language, and you can only 'die' as Inkling.

This project is just a joke.
